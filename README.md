<h1 align="center"> Hey there! 👋<br>
  I'm Daphne Virlar-Knight </h1>

<h3 align="center"> Projects Data Coordinator at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis </h3>
<br>

### ❄️ What do I actually do?
I help contribute to the open data science community by curating the metadata of datasets submitted to the [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/) repository! Generally, this is done by editing metadata documents using the [Ecological Metadata Language](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/) (EML), which describes the *who, what, where, when, why, and how* of a dataset. By curating metadata, the Arctic Data Center helps ensure that data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by others.

### 🌱 What am I up to?
Current projects include training and overseeing our team of interns; editing our living training document; writing functions to make our workflows more efficient; and curating metadata! So much metadata.
