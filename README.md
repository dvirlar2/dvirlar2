  I'm Daphne Virlar-Knight </h1>

### What do I actually do?
I help contribute to the open data science community by curating the metadata of datasets submitted to the [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/) repository! Generally, this is done by editing metadata documents using the [Ecological Metadata Language](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/) (EML), which describes the *who, what, where, when, why, and how* of a dataset. By curating metadata, the Arctic Data Center helps ensure that data are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by others.
